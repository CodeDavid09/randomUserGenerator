# randomUserGenerator
Using the Vue Tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) create an app that will generate a random user 
when you click on the 'Get Random User' button. 

WHEN the User clicks on the button, 
THEN it will generate a random user. 
WHEN application returns random user
THEN user can view profile image, First and Last Name, and email.
WHEN the profile image comes up, 
THEN the background color of that image should be blue or pink depending on the gender of the person.
